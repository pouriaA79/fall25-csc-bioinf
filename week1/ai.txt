AI TOOL AND MODEL
ChatGPT â€” GPT-5 Thinking
------------------------------------
WHAT I USED AI FOR
1.Explaining Codon type-realization errors and adding explicit type hints to classes.

2.Rewriting recursive DFS logic to an iterative (stack-based) version to avoid recursion limits.

3. Writing a robust evaluate.sh to run Python & Codon, time them.

-------------------
PROMPTS

1. Codon throws NoneType has no __hash__ during dict realization in my DBG. Show how to add explicit type annotations for my graph classes. I need fields like children set, counts, kmer string, visited, depth, and max-depth-child. Give a minimal example using from typing import Set, Optional

2. Convert my recursive DFS that computes longest-path depth in a De Bruijn graph into an iterative version with an explicit stack

3. Write a Bash script week1/evaluate.sh that:

    * Runs Python and Codon entries on datasets data1..data3.

    * Times each run (in seconds).

    * Computes N50 with a small inline Python snippet
